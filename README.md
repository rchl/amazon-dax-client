# Amazon DAX Client for JavaScript

DAX is a DynamoDB-compatible caching service that enables you to benefit from fast in-memory performance for demanding applications.

This client library provides access from NodeJS to DAX.

## Installing
The Amazon DAX client only runs from NodeJS, and can be installed using npm:
```sh
npm install amazon-dax-client
```

## Usage and Getting Started
You can follow the Getting Started tutorial at:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAX.client.sample-app.html

To quickly use DAX, replace `AWS.DynamoDB` with `AmazonDaxClient`:

```javascript
const AmazonDaxClient = require('amazon-dax-client');

// Replace this ...
const ddb = new AWS.DynamoDB({region: region});
/// with this ...
const endpoint = "your-cluster-discovery-endpoint";
const dax = new AmazonDaxClient({endpoints: [endpoint], region: region});

// If using AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient ...
const doc = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({service: dax});
```

The DAX Cluster Discovery Endpoint can be found the AWS console or by using `aws dax describe-clusters` from the command line.

Creating a connection to your DAX cluster requires using the Cluster Discovery Endpoint URL returned in the DescribeClusters response as the endpoint.

For example:
```javascript
// Format: const endpoint = <ClusterDiscoveryEndpoint.URL>;
const endpoint = 'dax://my-cluster.abc123.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com';
```
